Peer Review - 
Mobile and Desktop versions look good.
When handling the images you can use the React <Image/> tag and import the images at the top to keep the code a little neater. 
Good use of useStates and useEffect to get the calculator to update and reset. 
Percent Buttons could have been components as well to keep code neater but this way works just fine as well
